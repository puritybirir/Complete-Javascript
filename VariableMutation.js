 //Type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another (such as string to number, object to boolean, and so on)

 var firstName = "John";
 var age = 28;

console.log(firstName + ' ' + age);

var job, isMarried;
job = "married";
isMarried = false;

//Variable mutation
age = 'twenty eight'
